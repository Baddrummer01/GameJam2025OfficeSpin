This is a project being made for the Boss Rush Game Jam 2025. 
Information on the game jam can be found here: https://itch.io/jam/boss-rush-jam-2025

The announced theme for this game jam is "SPIN".

My idea is making each boss an object that can spin and the player is a spinning office chair (this came to me while spinning in an office chair trying to think of an idea).
The player spins faster and faster while dodging a bullet hell. When they reach maximum charge, the controls switch to steering while the player tries to deal as much damage
as possible (while invulnerable).

This project was made using Godot and its GDscript component.
I use a trello board for keeping track of the project's individual aspects.
